The pursuit of excellence led me to become a Chartered Accountant, equipping me with a strong foundation in financial reporting and analysis. My commitment to continuous learning drove me to pass CFA Level I, adding depth to my investment knowledge. Currently, I'm enhancing my technical expertise through an MBA in SAP Finance and Business Analytics at Maharishi International University, focusing on the intersection of traditional finance and modern analytics.

      To stay at the cutting edge of technology, I've earned certifications in SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, enabling me to transform complex data into actionable insights. This combination of financial expertise and technical skills allows me to bridge the gap between traditional finance and modern analytical tools.`,

Working with over 100 clients across diverse sectors ‚Äì from banking to renewable energy ‚Äì I learned that every business has a unique story hidden in its numbers.

      The turning point in my career came at NIC Asia Bank Limited. Here, I wasn't just analyzing numbers; I was revolutionizing processes. By implementing ERP solutions, we transformed operations across 300+ business lines, reducing departmental costs by 78% and paperwork by 70%. This experience taught me that financial analysis isn't just about tracking performance ‚Äì it's about driving transformation.


      My journey then took an international turn at BeyondID, where I bridged operations between Nepal and San Francisco. Managing rapid growth while securing significant investments showed me the global impact of sound financial strategy.
